We are a small, dynamic group at [Montana State University](http://www.montana.edu/). We pursue new precision measurements and addresses fundamental physics questions. We utilize microparticles and nanoparticles levitated in magnetic, optical, and Paul traps under vacuum to make sensitive measurements with controlled coupling to the environment. Two specific goals we are currently pursuing include fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity and a new approach to a precision measurement of the Newtonian gravitational constant G.
